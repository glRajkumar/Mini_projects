### Collections of mini MERN and React projects
Currently, This project consists of 4 projects(websites).
I created at various time and then combined to come under one project.
Previously each project has a seperated repos. I changed only some of the code to work under one project.
(Since i don't want to spend much time on it, I leave most of the code as it is. So It may not be look like in current trend or my way of coding)
You can also check previous code under Dropped folder.
